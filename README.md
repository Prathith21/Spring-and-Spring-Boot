# **Spring**<br/>
  Spring Boot is built on top of Spring framework. It is used for building enterprise level applications.We can work with dbs,ORM,Hibernate within Spring to build entire application.<br/>
    Spring is light weight framework that is build using plain old java objects. Spring when initially introduced was used for dependency injection as it contained one module. Later on Spring got lot of improvemnts and mainly projects within that got introduced. Spring is combo of multiple things. Spring is ecosystem.<br/>
    Spring involves lot of configurations like creating projects,configuring XML file, creating the beans but Sping Boot just runs in a go. 
## Inversion of Control
Inversion of Control maily refers to inverting control that is transferring control. Programmers mainly handle the role of both flow of program and managing objects that involve creating objects, destroying objects, maintaining objects. But how? <br/>
![IOC Container](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f79b932c-e962-48be-9083-4fc2423bf6de)<br/>
By using this IOC Container, this is the priciple that is followed to store objects the entire managememt of objects is done by Spring that is stored in IOC Container.<br/>
## Dependency Injection
Dependency Injection is the one that takes objects that are stores in IOC Container and gives it to the one that requires it. 

##Spring Boot Configuration
In Spring Boot if you need to change port you can do it by changing the port no in application properties as server.port = port no ( for ex: 8081)
